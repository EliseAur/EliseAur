###- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my studies in becoming a Front-end developer at Noroff. In June 2023 I have completed the first year of my studies. My last project before summer arrives is to make a portifolio site to show the projects that I've been developing so far. 

###- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript. At least that is what has been most challenging so far. In my last project my task was to create a blog site with content stored in a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS. So I built my blog site using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and made a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch data/content for my blog posts.
